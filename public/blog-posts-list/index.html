<p>Many architects and Infra/Platform developers take great pride on developing highly available systems.</p>
<p>We even invented code names for it like three nines or the nines of availability.</p>
<p>Do we realy need it? is it all so necessary?</p>
<p>There is a long list of requirments that comes with it.
Every new logic developer needs to be aware that their code will run in multiple active-active cluster, even active-active-active. As you can imagine, sometimes too active.</p>
<p>And the question is, is it necessary? Do we realy need to have active-active-active architecture?</p>
<p>In the past, I had the privilege of onboarding one more active to the active game. It wasn&rsquo;t taken lightly.</p>
