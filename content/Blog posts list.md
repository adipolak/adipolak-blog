# How Highly Available you are? Is it worth it?
Many architects and Infra/Platform developers take great pride on developing highly available systems.

We even invented code names for it like three nines or the nines of availability.

Do we realy need it? is it all so necessary?

There is a long list of requirments that comes with it.
Every new logic developer needs to be aware that their code will run in multiple active-active cluster, even active-active-active. As you can imagine, sometimes too active.

And the question is, is it necessary? Do we realy need to have active-active-active architecture?

In the past, I had the privilege of onboarding one more active to the active game. It wasn't taken lightly.
