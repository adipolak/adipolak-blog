# About

<img style="float: right;width:250px;" src="https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Polak.jpg;" alt="drawing">



I am a Sr. Software Engineer and Developer Advocate in the Azure Engineering organization at Microsoft.

My work focuses on distributed systems, big data analysis, and machine learning pipelines.

In my advocacy work, I bring my vast industry research & engineering experience to bear in educating and helping teams design, architect, and build cost-effective software and infrastructure solutions that emphasize scalability, team expertise, and business goals.

I am a frequent presenter at world-wide industry conferences and Oâ€™Reilly courses instructor.
I mentor and volunteer with underrepresented tech communities to help them find tech jobs and continue growing their career.

When I'm not building Machine Learning Pipelines or thinking up new software architecture,
you can find me hiking and camping in nature.

Opinions are my own.
