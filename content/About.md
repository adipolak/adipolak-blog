# About

<img style="float: right;width:150px;" src="https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Polak.jpg;" alt="drawing">



I worked at many companies at the intersection of distributed systems, big data analysis, and machine learning pipelines. Today, I am a Director at Confluent, focusing on Data Streaming and GenAI/ML capabilities. 


I am a frequent presenter at worldwide industry conferences and an O'Reilly book author and course instructor.
I mentor and volunteer with underrepresented tech communities to help them find tech jobs and continue growing their career.

When I'm not building Machine Learning Pipelines or thinking up new software architecture,
You can find me hiking and camping in the countryside.


Opinions are my own.
