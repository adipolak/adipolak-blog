Interested in learning about the Machine Learning side of Data? Hurry ðŸŽ‰ you have reached the right place to start learning about it.

Here is a list of concepts for you to get started:

## ML Algorithm 
ML algorithm is a procesure that run on data and produce machine learning model. Some of the popluar ones are Decision tress, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression.

## ML Model
ML model is the outcome of ML algorithm process, It is often contains a statistic representation of the data that was ingested into the algorithm. ML model input is data and the output is either a prediction, decision or classification.

## Training set
Training set is the data ingested into the machine learning algorithm, it is used to train the ML model. 

## Testing set
Testing set is the dataset we test the ml model with. For testing the accuracy of the ML model, we ingest the data into the model and measure the accuracy level of the outcome. It helps us reason about the quality of the machine learning.


## Machine Learning pipeline
Machine learning pipeline is an automation process of the machine learning workflow. It includes data transformation and correlation to fit the ML algorithm, running the algorithm to produce a model and testing it with a test set.

## Model interpretability
ML Model interpretability is the degree to which a human can reason the output of a machine learning model. The higher the degree, the easier it is for a human to understand the decision or prediction produced by the model.

## Data Quality
Data quality is the measure of the condition of the data, based on accuracy, precision, legitimacy, validity, reliability, consistency, completeness and more. In machine learning, data quality is importent for producing a high quality, non-bias machine learning models.

## Data drifts 
Data drift is unexpected and undocumented changes to data structure, semantics. Data drift can results in corrupted data and data low quality. Lack of awareness to data drift, can result in a lesser quality of ml models.

## Concept drift
Concept drift refers to the changes in target variables.
Target variables are the predictions outcomes we try to make using the machine learning models.
Concept drift can be detected by measuring the statistical properties of the target variables.
The actual target variable of machine learning can change over time in unforeseen ways and presents a challenge since the predictions become less accurate as time passes.
